      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last updated: <strong>December 3, 2025</strong></p>

      <p>
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the website, content, products, and services
        provided by <strong>Happy Healing</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”). By accessing or using our website, submitting an intake
        form, or purchasing any plan or product, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years old and able to enter into a binding contract to use our services.
        By using our website or purchasing a plan, you represent that you meet these requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Not medical advice</h2>
      <p>
        Happy Healing provides <strong>educational content and lifestyle experiments</strong> intended to help you explore
        changes to your diet and daily routines. We do <strong>not</strong> provide medical care, diagnosis, or treatment.
      </p>
      <p>You understand and agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our content and plans are for informational and educational purposes only and are not a substitute
          for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
        </li>
        <li>
          You should always consult your physician or other qualified health provider regarding any questions you have
          about your health, treatment, medications, or before making significant changes to your diet or activity.
        </li>
        <li>
          You should never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of something
          you read on our site or receive from our services.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Personal responsibility and risk</h2>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for your own health decisions, actions, and outcomes. By using our services, you agree that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You will use your own judgment and consult with your healthcare providers before acting on any information
          from Happy Healing.
        </li>
        <li>
          You understand that any lifestyle experiment (including changes to food, walking, and other daily habits)
          carries some risk, and you voluntarily assume full responsibility for those risks.
        </li>
        <li>
          If at any time you feel unwell, experience concerning symptoms, or have changes in your blood sugar or other
          markers, you will seek appropriate medical attention.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Use of the services</h2>
      <p>When you use our website or purchase a plan, you agree that you will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate and honest information in any intake forms or communications</li>
        <li>Use our content and plans for your personal, non-commercial use only</li>
        <li>Not attempt to reverse engineer, scrape, or misuse the website or any tools we provide</li>
        <li>Not use the services for any unlawful or harmful purpose</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Payments and refunds</h2>
      <p>
        When you purchase a plan or product, you agree to pay the listed price (e.g., the one-time $29 fee for a
        custom 3-week experiment) plus any applicable taxes or fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payments are processed by a third-party provider (such as Stripe). By completing a purchase, you also agree
        to their terms and policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise stated on the purchase page, all sales are
        <strong>generally considered final</strong> once your intake has been submitted and work on your custom plan has begun.
        If you believe there has been an error or issue, please contact us and we will review it on a case-by-case basis.
      </p>

      <h2>6. No guarantees of specific results</h2>
      <p>
        We believe that meaningful lifestyle changes can help many people improve their blood sugar and overall health.
        However, we <strong>do not guarantee</strong> any specific outcomes, such as particular changes in blood sugar,
        A1C, medication requirements, weight, or other health markers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your results will depend on many factors, including your starting health status, medications,
        adherence to the plan, and factors outside of our control.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>
        The content on our website and in your custom plan (including text, structure, and materials) is owned by or
        licensed to Happy Healing and is protected by copyright and other laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the materials for your personal,
        non-commercial use. You may not reproduce, distribute, publicly display, or create derivative works from our content
        without our prior written permission.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Third-party services and links</h2>
      <p>
        Our website may contain links to third-party sites or services, such as payment processors, educational resources,
        or social media platforms. We are not responsible for the content, policies, or practices of those third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your use of third-party sites is at your own risk and subject to their terms and privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, Happy Healing and its owners, employees, contractors, and affiliates
        will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or in
        connection with your use of (or inability to use) our website or services, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Health outcomes or changes in your medical status</li>

        <li>Any loss of data, profits, or business opportunities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If any liability is found despite these limitations, our total liability for all claims related to the services
        will be limited to the amount you paid for the relevant plan or product.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Happy Healing and its owners, employees, contractors, and affiliates
        from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
        arising out of or related to:

        <li>Your violation of these Terms</li>
        <li>Your violation of any rights of another person or entity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>11. Changes to the services</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the website or services at any time, with or without notice,
        including changing prices, updating content, or improving tools.

      </p>

      <h2>13. Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where Happy Healing is based, without regard to its
        conflict of laws principles. Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the services will be
        handled by the courts of that jurisdiction, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
