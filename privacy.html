      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last updated: <strong>December 3, 2025</strong></p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Happy Healing</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and protects
        your information when you visit our website, use our intake forms, or purchase a plan or product

      <p>
        Happy Healing is an online service that offers education and personalized lifestyle experiments
        for people with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes. We are <strong>not</strong> a medical practice and do
        not provide medical care, diagnosis, or treatment.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
